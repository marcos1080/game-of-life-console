# game-of-life-console
Game of life implementation in c# for console app.

Written for a university assignment. 
The language is c# and the framework is dotnet core 2.2.

To get it working a sqlserver needs to be set up and a database created using the schema provided.
The appsettings.json database connection string then needs to be set.


The interfaces were provided as a starting point and we needed to implement them to get a working solution.
